# Rewards for Completing Peer-Reviewed Research

## Project Title
**Rewards for Completing Peer-Reviewed Research**

## Project Description
This project aims to provide a smart contract solution to reward researchers with tokens upon the successful completion and peer-review of their research papers. The contract allows researchers to submit their papers, and once a paper is reviewed and approved by designated reviewers, the author is rewarded with a pre-defined amount of tokens.

The project incentivizes the completion of high-quality research and ensures that the authors are fairly compensated for their work.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a decentralized system where research efforts are rewarded transparently and securely using blockchain technology. This smart contract helps solve the issue of rewarding researchers and ensuring the fair distribution of rewards based on peer review results. It also promotes a more efficient and trustworthy research ecosystem.

- **Transparency**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain.
- **Efficiency**: Automated reward distribution after peer review.
- **Security**: Ensures that funds are only transferred when proper conditions (approval) are met.

## Key Features
- **Research Paper Submission**: Researchers can submit their papers to the system.
- **Peer Review Process**: Reviewers can approve or reject research papers and set reward amounts.
- **Reward Distribution**: Approved papers receive token rewards, which are sent directly to the author's wallet.
- **Token-Based Rewards**: Uses ERC-20 tokens for rewarding researchers.
- **Admin Functions**: Allows the contract owner to deposit reward tokens into the contract.
